polygon.io data puller

This is the simplest method to pull data from polygon.io at the present that I can find.

I suggest opening this with jupyter notebook from anaconda-navigator to easily edit.

You type the name of the asset you want. And run it.

It will automatically pull data from about the last 2 years, well last 24 of 28 day periods that is. Feel free to ask for more or less data.
